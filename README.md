****Fix collision
	
**We need many different types of platforms(subclasses). We are limited to rectangle hitboxes. 
	Type:
	
	-note that we CAN use a sawblade with a circle hitbox because if there is any collision, meatboy automatically dies. We just cannot have rounded/slanted platforms yet.

	-the platforms pairs that alternate, one becoming invisible, the other becoming visible

	-platforms that disappear after they are touched

	-moving platforms

	-spikes

	-??? Add any ideas in this readme.
